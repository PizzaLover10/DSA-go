Any PRs without being assigned the issue will be closed immediately.

## 2. Forking the repository

Since you cannot directly make changes to the main repository, fork it.

## 3. Clone the forked repository

Make sure that your fork is up-to-date with the main repository and then clone it locally to start working on it using -  
``` git clone https://github.com/username/DSA-go.git```
